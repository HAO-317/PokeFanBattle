## Game Overview
PokéFan Battle Game is a single-player game where you face off against a CPU opponent in a turn-based battle. Choose your PokéFan-inspired moves (represented as objects A, B, C, and a special object D) to outsmart the CPU. The game offers two modes: **Goal Mode** (win a set number of rounds) and **Infinity Mode** (survive as long as possible). With customizable difficulty levels and a points system, you can test your skills and aim for a high score!

The game features a nostalgic PokéFan theme with a stadium background, animated effects, and soundtracks that enhance the battle atmosphere.

## Features
- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Goal Mode**: Win a specific number of rounds (3, 5, 7, or 10) to claim victory.
  - **Infinity Mode**: Survive as long as possible, earning extra lives as you progress.
- **Difficulty Levels**: Choose between Normal and Hard modes to adjust the challenge.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Enjoy visual effects like electric sparks, life-gain animations, and a special "Object D" popup.
- **Sound Effects and Music**: Immersive audio with opening, battle, and end themes, plus sound effects for actions like winning, losing, or selecting moves.
- **Points System**: Earn points based on your performance, with bonuses for Hard mode and Infinity mode milestones.
